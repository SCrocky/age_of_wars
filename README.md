# Age of Wars

A free, open-source medieval RTS built with Python and Pygame. Gather resources, raise an army, and crush your enemies — alone or with a friend over LAN.

No installs beyond Python. No accounts. No monetisation. Ever.

## Prerequisites

Download the **[Tiny Swords (Free Pack)](https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/tiny-swords)** asset pack and place the zip — unmodified, still named `Tiny Swords (Free Pack).zip` — in the `downloaded_assets/` folder at the repo root. The game reads sprites straight from the zip, so there's no need to extract it.

```
age_of_tiny_wars/
└── downloaded_assets/
    └── Tiny Swords (Free Pack).zip
```

If you'd rather keep the zip elsewhere, point `ASSETS_ZIP` at it (e.g. `ASSETS_ZIP=/path/to/Tiny\ Swords\ \(Free\ Pack\).zip`).

## Play the game

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Single-player (server runs in solo mode against an AI opponent)
python server_main.py --solo
python client_main.py

# Multiplayer — host
python server_main.py

# Multiplayer — join
python client_main.py
```

## How it works

Collect **gold**, **wood**, and **meat** to build up your base and train troops. Your **Castle** is both your stronghold and spawn point — lose it and it's over.

| Building | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Castle | Base, spawns Pawns |
| House | Raises population cap, acts as a resource depot |
| Archery | Trains Archers |
| Barracks | Trains Warriors and Lancers |
| Monastery | Trains Monks |
| Tower | Defensive structure — garrison an Archer for extra range and damage |

| Unit | Role |
|---|---|
| Pawn | Gathers resources, constructs buildings |
| Archer | Ranged — picks off enemies from a distance |
| Warrior | Heavy melee — blocks the first hit every swing |
| Lancer | Fast melee — 8-directional attacks |
| Monk | Support — heals nearby allied units |

## Contributing

This game is a gift to the community — and a work in progress. If you want to help shape it, you're very welcome.

Good places to start:

- **New unit or building** — add a class under `entities/`, drop a sprite in `assets/`, register it in `game.py`
- **New map** — edit or extend `map_editor/` to generate different terrain layouts
- **Balance tweaks** — unit stats live at the top of each file in `entities/`
- **Bug reports** — open an issue, describe what happened and how to reproduce it
- **Art** — sprites are plain PNGs, 192×192 for units. Any style that fits the medieval theme is welcome

The codebase is intentionally kept readable. There's no build step and no framework magic — just Python files you can open and change.
